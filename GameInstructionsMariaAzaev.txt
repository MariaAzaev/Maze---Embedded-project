Welcome to my game:

1. First you must choose the difficulty level and the type of maze you want to play. 
Pressing the S2 key will mark your selection and with the potentiometer you can scroll through the options.
2. Now, the game starts according to your choices - pay attention to the timer, 
as soon as it reaches 0 the game is over and you go back to the menu and you have the option to play again.
3. In order to win the game you must reach the end point in the maze - the yellow dot.
3. After finishing the game in any way (either because the time ran out or because you won) pressing S1 will return you to the menu if the time ran out. 
If you win, pressing S1 will show you the score you earned during the game. Pressing S1 again will return you back to the menu.

Good luck :)
